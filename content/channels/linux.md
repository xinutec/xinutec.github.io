# #linux

`#linux` is Xinutec's main channel.

The name is for historical reasons (it was started as a fork of another
channel) and most of the time discussion isn't about Linux.

## Modes

Users with any client certificate are voiced. The voice attribute doesn't do
anything in most IRC networks, so we use it as a means to identify people who
are theoretically able to help with channel management affairs. No warranty.

Usually, the topic is not locked, so anyone can change it.

## nerv

nerv is a bot with a few commands.

* `!seen <user>` displays when "user" was last online
