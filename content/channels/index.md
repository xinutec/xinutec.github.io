Channels
--------

`#linux` is the main channel. The name is for historical reasons (it was
started as a fork of another channel) and most of the time discussion isn't
about Linux.

If you run a channel, you may host a channel homepage (static HTML only) on
this website. To do so, simply fork our
[github repository](https://github.com/xinutec/xinutec.github.io/)
and create a pull request once your changes are is in place. A staff member
will then review, fix, and approve it.
