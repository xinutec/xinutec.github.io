Xinutec isn't a topical network, but most of us are huge geeks and technology
fans. We don't bite and fresh meat is always welcome. Happy chatting!

Connecting to Xinutec
---------------------

You are welcome to connect to our network using the round robin DNS name
[irc.xinutec.net](ircs://irc.xinutec.net/linux). IPv6 is supported on most
servers, and the DNS will resolve to the right address record. We currently
still allow [plain text](irc://irc.xinutec.net/linux) connections via port
6667, but will soon only allow SSL secured connections via port 6697.  We
provide web-based access to the network is with our self-hosted
[qwebirc](http://qwebirc.xinutec.net/) via IPv4. It is also possible to
connect using other IRC web-clients, but we recommend against using them,
since we don't control their privacy policy.

See the page on [IRC](irc) for more information on connecting to the network.

Channels
--------

`#linux` is the main channel. If you run a channel, you are free to host a
channel homepage (static HTML only) on this server. To do this, simply fork
our [github repository](https://github.com/xinutec/xinutec.github.io/) and
create a pull request once your changes are is in place. A staff member will
then review and approve it.
