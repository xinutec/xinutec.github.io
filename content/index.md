Xinutec isn't a topical network, but most of us are huge geeks and technology
fans. We don't bite and fresh meat is always welcome. Happy chatting!

Connecting to Xinutec
---------------------

Please use the round robin DNS on [irc.xinutec.net](irc://irc.xinutec.net).
IPv6 is also supported via this host name. We currently still support
unencrypted connections via port 6667, but will soon only allow SSL
connections via port 6697. Web-based access to the network is available with
[qwebirc](http://qwebirc.xinutec.net/) via IPv4.

Each of our servers is equipped with a certificate issued by the Xinutec IRC
Certificate Authority. We recommend downloading and installing the authority's
[CA certificate](irc/ca.crt) to verify the server's identity. If your client
supports CRLs (certificate revocation lists), you may additionally link it to
the [CRL](irc/crl.pem). In general, you would not download the CRL, as it can
change. The CA certificate, on the other hand, *should* be downloaded, as it
may never change. If it does, that means it was compromised. If this happens
to you, please contact one of our administrators as soon as possible.

Channels
--------

`#linux` is the main channel. If you run a channel, you are free to host a
channel homepage (static HTML only) on this server. To do this, simply fork
our [github repository](https://github.com/xinutec/xinutec.github.io/) and
create a pull request once your changes are is in place. A staff member will
then review and approve it.

People
------

These are the network operators/staff (effective or retired) with links to
their homepages:

- [maito](http://maito.name/)
- [Palo](http://des-grauens.de/)

Additionally, these non-staff people have requested that a link to their

People with an affiliation (i.e. regulars) to the network can also host a user
page on this server, similar to a channel page.
