Xinutec is a chat network and associated group of people who sometimes do
projects together, and which exists in the current form since approximately
2006.

We're a group of people who are enthusiastic for computers and software related
projects, but we also generally like creative ideas, science, social
innovation, free software, talking to each other about our life and a lot more.
If you're interested, even if you think you're none of these things I've just
use to describe us, please check out our IRC network.

If you're new to this whole IRC business, we recommend that you join using the
[Webchat](https://qwebirc.xinutec.net/?channels=%23linux) and we'll just
explain everything to you once you're there. Otherwise, [read on](irc/connect).
