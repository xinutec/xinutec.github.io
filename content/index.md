Xinutec isn't a topical network, but most of us are huge geeks and technology
fans. We don't bite and fresh meat is always welcome. Happy chatting!

Connecting to Xinutec
---------------------

You are welcome to connect to our network using the round robin DNS name
[irc.xinutec.net](ircs://irc.xinutec.net/linux). IPv6 is supported on most
servers, and the DNS will resolve to the right address record. We currently
still allow [plain text](irc://irc.xinutec.net/linux) connections via port
6667, but will soon only allow SSL secured connections via port 6697.

*Important*: If you're connecting for the first time, please make sure to read
the article about [connecting to xinutec](irc/connect) because we offer a
network-wide SSL certification authority which you should enable in your
client. (Boo to you if you don't, you might be compromising the safety of the
entire network and make yourself vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks). It's
a flaw of the SSL protocol that we can't actually force you to do this.

Please note that SSL isn't sufficient for true privacy and you should always
use end-to-end encryption like OTR to encrypt private messages.

In addition to IRC connections we also provide web-based access to the network
is with our self-hosted [qwebirc](https://qwebirc.xinutec.net/) (already SSL
only) via IPv4. It is also possible to connect using other IRC web-clients, but
we recommend against using them, since we don't control their privacy policy.

See the page on [IRC](irc) for more information on connecting to the network.

Channels
--------
  
`#linux` is the main channel. It is called like that for historical reasons (it
was started as a fork of another channel) and most of the time discussion isn't
about linux.

If you run a channel, you are free to host a channel homepage (static HTML
only) on this server. To do this, simply fork our 
[github repository](https://github.com/xinutec/xinutec.github.io/)
and create a pull request once your changes are is in place. A staff member
will then review and approve it.

------

These are the network operators/staff (effective or retired) with links to
their homepages:

People with an affiliation (i.e. regulars) to the network can also host a user
page on this server, similar to a channel page.
