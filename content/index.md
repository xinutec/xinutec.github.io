Xinutec isn't a topical network, but most of us are huge geeks and technology
fans. We don't bite and fresh meat is always welcome. Happy chatting!

Connecting to Xinutec

channel homepage (static HTML only) on this server. To do this, simply fork
our [github repository](https://github.com/xinutec/xinutec.github.io/) and
create a pull request once your changes are is in place. A staff member will
