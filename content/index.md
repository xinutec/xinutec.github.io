Xinutec is an IRC based chat network and associated group of people who
sometimes do projects together. It exists since approximately 2006.

Among our shared interests are computers and Free Software related projects, but we
also generally like creative ideas, science, social innovation, talking to each
other like friends normally do and a lot more.

If you're interested, even if you think none of these things I've just used to
describe us apply to you but we might get along anyway, feel free to check it out.

If you're new to this whole IRC business, we recommend that you join using the
[Webchat](https://webchat.xinutec.net/) and we'll just
explain everything to you once you're there. Otherwise, [read on](connect).

We don't bite if it isn't consensual.
